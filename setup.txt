For future reminder. How I set up this web project.

npm install latest-version
brew install node js (update it)
cd Projects
git clone https://github.com/matthewtglove/habit-highway (Have to move things around after using Vite, there's probably a better way to do it)
npm create vite@latest habit-highway -- --template react-ts (from https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
cd habit-highway
npm install

âœ… npm run dev (use to start the test server)
